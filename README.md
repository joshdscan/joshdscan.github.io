## üìö Projects

### Transforming Clinical Trial Labeling

This project focuses on addressing the high costs and low success rates associated with clinical trials. It develops a machine learning solution to automate the labeling of clinical trials based on termination reasons. By leveraging the transformer model, the project aims to reduce the manual curation burden and enhance the efficiency of identifying viable clinical trial candidates via multi-label classification.

#### Key Highlights
- Developed a machine learning solution for automating clinical trial labeling.
- F1 score showed to be 35% higher than that of the logistic regression model.

### Automating Article Selection with Margin Insight

In this project, machine learning is used to automate the article selection process, focusing on articles likely to exceed 1400 shares for increased profitability. Utilizing a dataset of 40,000 articles with 61 features, including keyword counts and NLP metrics, this project employs a Random Forest model. This model boasts a 66% accuracy rate, surpassing the K-Nearest Neighbors model's 58%.
