## üìö Projects

### Transforming Clinical Trial Labeling

This project focuses on addressing the high costs and low success rates associated with clinical trials. It develops a machine learning solution to automate the labeling of clinical trials based on termination reasons. By leveraging transformer models and logistic regression classifiers, the project aims to reduce the manual curation burden and enhance the efficiency of identifying viable clinical trial candidates.

#### Key Highlights
- Developed a machine learning solution for automating clinical trial labeling.
- Employed transformer models and logistic regression classifiers for performance benchmarking.

### Automating Article Selection with Margin Insight

In this project, machine learning is used to automate the article selection process, focusing on articles likely to exceed 1000 shares for increased profitability. Utilizing a dataset of 40,000 articles with 61 features, including keyword counts and NLP metrics, this project employs a Random Forest model. This model boasts a 66% accuracy rate, surpassing the K-Nearest Neighbors model's 58%.

The Random Forest model is recommended for deployment to enhance article selection efficiency, with predictions aimed at generating significant revenue. This initiative demonstrates the potential of machine learning in optimizing content curation and transforming media operations towards profitability.
